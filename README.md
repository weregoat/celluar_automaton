# Background

I was introduced to the idea of elementary cellular automaton 
by a coding test for a job application. 
At the time I was not able complete the assignment in time so, 
finding the idea interesting, I am writing a program on my own also as
way to explore GoLang further.

# Note about the general solution
I prefer to see the configurations as "string" as, as such, they make more sense
to me as a "living" automaton. I understand I could have used binaries to solve it,
but I like thinking of it as "cells" living or dying more interesting and easier
to understand.
